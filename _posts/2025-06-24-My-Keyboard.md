title: my keyboard doesn't speak for me
---

I've been thinking about keyboards lately.

Not in a mechanical switch vs membrane kind of way. (Though let's be honest, there's no argument to be had.) No, this is something else. Something more conceptual. Or maybe just sad.

I type all day. Code, messages, notes to myself I'll never read again. And somewhere along the line, I started wondering if the keyboard is part of the problem.

It's not expensive. It's efficient. That's not the same thing.

I tried to fix it the only way I know how: remapping keys. Caps Lock became Control. Escape moved to where my fingers already go by mistake. I even made a custom layout once where semicolon required a chorded combo, just to see if I'd stop overusing it.

It felt like therapy. Tiny, clicky therapy.

I told myself if I could just find the right layou, if I could *feel* good while typing, maybe I'd write more clearly. Maybe I'd write more, full stop.

Instead, I built a keyboard that's ergonomically optimized for indecision.

The truth is, I keep trying to make my tools more "me," thinking it will make me more *me*. But the keyboard is just plastic. The font is just pixels. The terminal prompt I've styled six different ways doesn't actually *know* me.

All these little tweaks - fonts, dotfiles, themes - they're not *personality.* They're just preferences in costume.

I've been telling myself it matters. That how I code is a reflection of who I am. That my shell is my shrine. But lately, I'm starting to think maybe I've just been rearranging furniture in a room I never invite anyone into.

Anyway, my terminal font is JetBrains Mono now. That helped.
