I've been thinking about gravity lately.

Not the kind that keeps your feet on the ground... the other kind. The kind that pulls you back into places you thought you'd left behind. Tabs. Logins. Timelines. Whatever this is.

Coming back online isn't a switch. It's more like creeping back through a side door. You don't announce it. You just start showing up again.

It's strange how even typing something out here feels loud. Like I'm tapping on the glass to see if anyone's still around.

There's no big reason for this post. I just missed writing. I missed having a place to throw a few thoughts now and then. No promise of consistency, no project, no theme.

Just me. Just figuring it out. But here, at least, for now.
