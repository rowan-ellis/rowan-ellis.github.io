I am not a brand. I am a weather pattern.

I've never understood the obsession with "building a personal brand." It feels like taxidermy, taking something once alive, stripping it to an outline, stuffing it with keywords and curated imagery until what's left is technically recognizable but no longer capable of motion.

I am not a brand.

Brands are consistent. Polished. Predictable. I am inconsistent on purpose.

Some days I post technical writeups about obscure privacy configurations. Some days I disappear for weeks. Some days I write something soft, or strange, or completely off-theme.

That isn't a mistake. That's the weather shifting.

If you need consistency to engage with a person, follow a product, not a human. If you want clear messaging, hire marketing. If you want growth-hacked authenticity, there's a sea of sanitized ghostwriters offering "relatable" vulnerability.

I'm not here to optimize your engagement funnel.

I'm here because I needed somewhere to put the things that wouldn't stay quiet in my head anymore. And if you're still reading, maybe you did too.

I'll keep writing. Not for reach. Not for relevance. But because when the wind changes, I want to know I left a trail worth following.
