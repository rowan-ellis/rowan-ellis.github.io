title: three tabs open
---

There's a kind of honesty in a browser window. Now the history - no one's that brave - but in the present. The open tabs. The ones you haven't closed. The ones you can't.

Today, mine look like this:

## 1. A forum thread from 2018

Someone troubleshooting a ThinkPad boot loop. No replies, no resolution, just long silence and a final edit: "Nevermind, fixed it.". I've been staring at that line for like twenty minutes. I wonder what they did. I wonder if it really worked. Thanks for sharing your solution, asshole.

## 2. An article on digital minimalism

You know the type. Monochrome layout, serif fonts. "Reclaim your focus."

I've had it open for three days and haven't made it past the pull quote, but I like knowing it's there. Like a candle I never light.

## 3. My own GitHub profile

I'm trying to remember what I used to sound like when I was excited. Before I wrote code like I was apologizing for it.

That's all. No secrets today.

Just a browser window, open too long.
